# Strustegy

Validation library for Rust with emphasis on the Strategy pattern

## Features

### Flexible Validations: Define your own validation strategies and chain them together to create complex validation routines.
### Generic Associated Types (GATs): Emulate higher-kinded types (HKTs) and create generic validations that can be applied to any type.
### Composite Validations: Easily create composite validations by chaining together multiple strategies.
### Partial Validations: Perform partial validations and decide on the next steps based on the results.

## Disclaimer

This library is still in early development. The API is still subject to change.
